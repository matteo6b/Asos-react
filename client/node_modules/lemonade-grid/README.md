# Lemonade

Lemonade is a a simple, flexible and easy-to-customise grid system. It was created in order to give designers & developers a kickstart with their projects. It currently supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera & IE 9+, also supports major phone devices too.

## Installation

-   Clone `git clone https://github.com/dope/lemonade.git`
-   [Download the latest version](https://github.com/dope/lemonade/archive/master.zip)
-   Install with Bower: `bower install lemonade`


## Getting Started
Getting started couldn't be easier

#### First you need to link the stylesheet
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/lemonade.css">
```

#### Structuring your layouts
```html
<div class="frame">
    <div class="bit-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="bit-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="bit-3">Content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating a three-column layout (for galleries for example) is really simple, this will scale down to 100% on mobile. Wrap the .bit's in a .frame class to clear the floats.

#### Customising your grid
Maybe you want to go old school and create a two-column layout, It's so easy all you need is basic math (along as the .bit- classes equal to 100%, it will be perfect).
```html
<div class="frame">
    <div class="bit-75">Content here</div>
    <div class="bit-25">Content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating the css is also simple:
```css
.bit-75 {width:75%;}
.bit-25 {width:25%;}
```
